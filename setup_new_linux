" Set default shell to zsh

I found this on superuser forum

Open /etc/passwd:

sudo vi /etc/passwd
Find the line with your username:

username:x:1634231:100:Your Name:/home/username:/bin/bash
and replace bash with zsh:

username:x:1634231:100:Your Name:/home/username:/bin/zsh
Log out and log in back for the changes to take effect.
